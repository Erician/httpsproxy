# httpsproxy
this is a proxy for http and https with the tunnel technology

Note: I did not follow the RFC(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.6) about sending CONNECT method to proxy server before transport real data,
Which make the client easy to use the program but is not safe.

Note: This program is just for learning, and maybe it is not safe. So I suggest you do not use this program when refered to your important infomation like credit card, account, shopping info, etc.
